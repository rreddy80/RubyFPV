# Ruby: Digital FPV Radio System
Ruby is a complete solution (hardware and software) for robust end to end digital radio links, designed specifically for controlling and managing UAVs/drones/planes/cars and other remote vehicles

# Features highlights:

<B>Mutiple, rendundant radio links on 433/868/915 Mhz and 2.4/5.8 Ghz bands:</B>

Multiple redundant radio links in different bands (433Mhz, 868/915Mhz, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 5.8Ghz) can be used simultaneously between vehicles, ground control stations and relays for better resilience, link quality and range;

<B>Relaying:</B>

Mobile (vehicles) and/or fixed relay nodes can be inserted in the system for longer range and penetration beyond line of sight;

<B>Encryption:</B>

The radio links can be encrypted end to end so that only authorized components can decode the radio data;

<B>Live video, telemetry, remote control, auxiliary & custom data streams:</B>

By default Ruby supports all the required data capabilities for UAVs (video, telemetry, control and user defined data streams).

<B>Rich user interface/control interface;</B>

<B>SDKs for third party development of new features:</B>

There are public SDKs available so that 3rd parties can add custom functionalities and capabilities to Ruby system.
